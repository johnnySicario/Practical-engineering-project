<h5>About Mypet</h5>
Mypet is an online, searchable database of animals who need homes. It is also a directory of nearly 5,000 animal shelters and adoption organizations across Israel. Organizations maintain their own home pages and available-pet databases.

Our mission
To use Internet technology and the resources it can generate to:

Increase public awareness of the availability of high-quality adoptable pets
Increase the overall effectiveness of pet adoption programs across Israel to the extent that the euthanasia of adoptable pets is eliminated
Elevate the status of pets to that of family member
From the comfort of their personal computers, pet lovers can search for a pet that best matches their needs. They can then reference a shelterâ€™s web page and discover what services it offers. Mypet also includes discussion forums, a pet-care resource directory and a library of free pet-care articles to help keep pets in their homes.
